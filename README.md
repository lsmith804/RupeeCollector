# Rupee Collector

https://lonlonrancher.github.io/RupeeCollector/

Tasked with creating an application that gives the player a random number. Players are then able to click on a gem/rupee that has a (secret) random value. Each time one of the rupees is clicked, it adds to a running total. If the total generated from rupee-clicks matches the computer-generated number, the player wins. If the player total exceeds the random computer numbner, the player loses. Wins and losses are tracked and displayed onscreen. 

A combination of button onclick events, if statements, and jQuery selecting buttons by ID was used. This was excellent practice for understanding JS and jQuery usage.
